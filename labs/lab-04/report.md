# Lab 4

1. It's important to choose a license because, as someone who is starting a project, you want to have certain guidelines as to how others can use and redistribute your software without stunting the collaborative and free aspect of free software. In some cases you would want certain credit where it's due and a distinction between the source code and the modifications made, and a license can ensure that other people who improve your software for for other purposes are required to do so.
2. A project without a license is  all rights reserved and closed-source. This means that working on such a project puts your changes at risk of being taken down if released somewhere, and as someone developing on other projects, that would be a significant drawback.
3. I agree that one contributing factor to Gopher's failure is attributed to the closed off developing environment that they had. Limiting all the changes to a smaller group of people rather than a larger community prevented Gopher from delivering what is in demand and making improvements that people who actually use the software prefer. Additionally, "violating" that sense of trust with hackers likely greatly stunted the development of Gopher by hackers.

4. In the case of Linux, Torvalds actually switched the license because he wanted something that allows commercial redistribution. Different projects have different goals. For Linux, the ability to redistribute a free operating system commercially greatly benefits the widespread use of such software. Additionally, the GNU general Public License that it now uses is copyleft and ensures that any other work derived from it has to preserve the same rights. Linux's business model is meant to encourage a "symbiotic relationship" between vendors and Linux distributions, and free software licenses like GNU GPL "encourage commercialization". Tvorlands also chose the version 2 of the GPL and refuses to go to version 3 because, considering how many redistributions of Linux there are and how large the software is, it would be "impractical to obtain permission from all copyright holders".
