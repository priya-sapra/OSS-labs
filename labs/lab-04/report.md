1. It's important to choose a license because, as someone who is starting a project, you want to have certain guidelines as to how others can use and redistribute your software without stunting the collaborative and free aspect of free software. In some cases you would want certain credit where it's due and a distinction between the source code and the modifications made, and a license can ensure that other people who improve your software for their own needs does such a thing.
2. A project without a license is basically all rights reserved and closed-source. This means that working on such a project puts your changes at risk of being taken down if released somewhere.
