### Smart Questions
****This was touched upon in the article, but often I keep a running list of solutions I've tried and the resulting outcomes. This helps other people understand my confusion, or if it's in the case of getting some piece of code to work, it helps me and other backtrace where things may have gone astray.

### Free Culture
It's really unfortunate that Jesse had to pick the lesser of two evils just for 'tinkering' with the search engine. I think that his story is a warning for anyone who sees themselves as just 'tinkering with technology' - it's important to be wary of all the people/corporations/organizations that can come after you before releasing something. The engine that Jesse made went on-line pretty quickly, so he probably didn't even take much time to consider all the ways people might use his engine (such as putting music files up there) as well as the possibility that organizations outside of RPI could come for him. Regardless, he shouldn't have had to be punished so cruelly for trying to extend his technical knowledge. This chapter made it clear to me that, even though I may have very pure intentions with the technology I work on, it can still be misused by users, either deliberately, or, as in Jesse's case, without even realizing it. The misuse of the technology I work on can have serious consequences because I am the one who built it and enabled the misuse of it.
